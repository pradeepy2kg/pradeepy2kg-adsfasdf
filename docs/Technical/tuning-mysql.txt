MySQL tables are bound by the underlying file systems space. Thus enough space should be allocated to the file system. When using Xen, allocate a large size for the disk, and let the size grow to this maximum dynamically as the dataset grows. This will allow easier backups while still allowing the database to hold a lot of data.

Tuning innodb_buffer_pool_size - http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/11/03/choosing-innodb_buffer_pool_size/
Its better to run MySQL on a separate machine, and allocate enough RAM to it - as much as possible

Use separate tablespaces for each table using innodb_file_per_table See http://vdachev.net/2007/02/22/mysql-reducing-ibdata1/


Manually Index the following tables as instructed
Schema PRS
Person - pin, nic, motherukey, father ukey
