MySQL tables are bound by the underlying file systems space. Thus enough space should be allocated to the file system. When using Xen, allocate a large size for the disk, and let the size grow to this maximum dynamically as the dataset grows. This will allow easier backups while still allowing the database to hold a lot of data.
